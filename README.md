This is a simple setup of my raspberry pi - arduino system. The uno is responsible for watering and regulating humidity and temperature around my cuctus plant. connected to the uno also is my desk lamp, desk pump and a kettle(about to be smart). Right now the pi is responsible for hosting a telegram bot(which I use as an interface for communicating with the system) and passing commands to the uno through serial communication.
